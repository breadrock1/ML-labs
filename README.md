# Machine Learning Labs
Machine Learning. This is set of laboratory tasks of Machine Learning.

## lab1 - KNN
To manipulate your data set by analogy with those considered: data preprocessing, predictions using the method of nearest neighbors.	

## lab2 - Pipeline and backup
Select and justify a quality metric. Try several machine learning methods from sklearn, see which method is best suited in the context of the selected metric (so far without selecting hyper parameters). Optimize KNN according to metric.
Wrap all previous actions with data (conversion, normalization, etc. - from the first and second labs) in Pipeline and save the resulting model in pickle.

## lab3 - Linearias and Regressions 
Train logistic regression on your data, select the parameters.
Compare the results of applying L1 and L2 regularizations. View the weights of signs, explain the obtained values.
Perform feature selection using L1 regularization, select the optimal C, explain the result.

## lab4 - Trees
Verify the instability of a single tree on its data.
Select the most important traits by random forest, compare the result with the selection of traits by a linear method with L1 -regulation.
Compare the performance of a random forest without cross-validation with cross-validation.
Compare the quality of work and the training time (% time at the beginning of the cell) of the forest with gradient boosting over decision trees, choosing the optimal parameters for each. It will be especially good if you train gradient boosting on a video card.

## lab5 - Neural networks
Collect a set of photos of your team members.
Train the neuron so that she will classify the new photos of the participants well.

## lab6 - NLP
Classify Russian texts into several categories. It is best if the body of the texts is really large. To pre-process texts: normalization, lemmatization, etc. Compare embeddings. Try several classification methods.
